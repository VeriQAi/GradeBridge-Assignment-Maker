## Data Storage & Privacy

### What Gets Stored

GradeBridge Assignment Maker stores data in **browser localStorage**:

- **Key**: `gradebridge_assignments`
- **Contains**: All created assignments
- **Size**: Typically 1-10 MB (varies with images)

### Privacy Guarantees

✅ **No server communication** - everything runs in your browser
✅ **No analytics or tracking**
✅ **No account required**
✅ **Data never leaves your computer** (unless you export)

### Data Persistence

- Data survives browser restarts
- Data survives computer restarts
- Data is **lost** if you:
  - Clear browser cache/localStorage
  - Use incognito/private mode
  - Switch browsers or computers

**Always export assignments as JSON backups!**

## Integration with Student Submission App

### Workflow

1. **Create Assignment** (Assignment Maker)
   - Design problems and subsections
   - Configure submission types
   - Export JSON and PDF

2. **Share with Students** (Assignment Maker → Students)
   - Provide the JSON file to students
   - Students use it in the **GradeBridge Student Submission** app

3. **Configure Gradescope** (Assignment Maker → Gradescope)
   - Upload the PDF template to Gradescope
   - Set grading regions (auto-detected if configured properly)

4. **Students Submit** (Student Submission App → Gradescope)
   - Students complete assignments in the submission app
   - Generate PDFs that match the template
   - Upload to Gradescope

### Companion App

**GradeBridge Student Submission**: https://veriqai.github.io/GradeBridge-Student-Submission/

Students use this app to:
- Load your assignment JSON
- Complete problems with text/images/AI reflections
- Generate properly formatted PDFs
- Submit to Gradescope

## Troubleshooting

### Assignment Won't Load

**Cause**: Invalid JSON format
**Solution**: Verify the JSON file is valid using a JSON validator. Ensure it was generated by Assignment Maker.

### LaTeX Not Rendering

**Cause**: KaTeX library failed to load
**Solution**: Check internet connection, refresh page. KaTeX loads from CDN.

### PDF Generation Fails

**Cause**: jsPDF library issue or memory limits
**Solution**:
- Reduce number of images
- Compress large images before adding
- Refresh the page and try again

### Lost Work After Closing Browser

**Cause**: Data was not saved or localStorage was cleared
**Solution**: Always export JSON backups regularly. Check browser settings for localStorage persistence.

### Images Not Appearing in PDF

**Cause**: Image file size too large or format unsupported
**Solution**:
- Use JPEG/PNG formats
- Compress images to under 2MB each
- Reduce image dimensions

## Development

### Code Style

- TypeScript with strict type checking
- Functional React components with hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ESLint/Prettier recommended
